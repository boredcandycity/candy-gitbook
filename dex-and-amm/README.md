# DEX & AMM

### Trade Tokens

You can swap all cronos chain tokens directly from your wallet at the lowest trading fee EVER 0.15%.

### Liquidity Pools

A DEX can only operate when there's enough liquidity to support trades. That's why we're using a portion of trading fees to provide Protocol Owned Liquidity so that the exchange will always work.

You can also provide liquidity and get LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees and you can then stake your LP Tokens in a farm to earn $CANDY.
