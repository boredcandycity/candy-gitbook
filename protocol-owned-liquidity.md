# Protocol Owned Liquidity

When you swap a token on Bored Candy City, you pay a **0.15% trading fee**, and a portion of the fees is used to buyback $CANDY and form Protocol Owned Liquidity

**0.10%** - Returned to liquidity pools as a reward for liquidity providers.

**0.05% -** Buy back of $CANDY to form $CANDY-$CRO LP\
\
NONE of the trading fees are kept by the team.

Buying back $CANDY from the market and forming LPs will create deflationary pressure on $CANDY, pushing the price & the trading volume up.

Plus, by forming LPs, we make sure that $CANDY never runs out of liquidity, even if this bear market goes on forever, there will always be liquidity for you to sell $CANDY.
